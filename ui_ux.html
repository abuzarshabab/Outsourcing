                                    The term "design" has a wide range of responsibilities. In the field of technology,
                                    design
                                    refers mainly to web or graphical design. With the arrival of new technologies
                                    daily, UI UX
                                    is the best way to sharing responsibility for the new way web design in India. UI
                                    and UX
                                    Design is not simply a website look, but focuses on the easy usage and influence of
                                    a
                                    company branding. Both complement each other because one helps you to have a great
                                    design
                                    and the latter is responsible. Syolo Outsourcing is ready to help you with the

                                    UX Design stands for the design of user experience whereas UI means the design of
                                    user
                                    interfaces. Analytical and technical design is UX design; Graph design is closer to
                                    UI
                                    design. The user interface can be understood as a way for users to interact with
                                    each other
                                    during user experience. Although the functionality of both appears similar but
                                    differ, the
                                    two contribute to a strong web presence.
