                            Websites are often hacked by cyber criminals who produce malicious software that visitors to

                            Misrepresented attacks are very common. I have a monthly deal with half a hundred different
                            sites, and one that is not affected by a malware attack has still to be seen. Actual attacks
                            were carried out by 5.6 billion malware in 2020. <strong>Google Search Console is one of the

                            Connections are essential for online visibility and often a loss of a high-level connection

                            identify a problem unless you monitor your back-links.

                            out (including us!) with most marketers. This is what we are doing to track ROI and the

                        <p class="p1">
                            Let's begin with website visitors' basics. They are engaged with your brand when someone
                            clicks on their website. They have shown a clear commitment and now we can move them from
                            the Customer Value Journey stage of awareness to the commitment stage. You will be able to
                            see how many people from particular social sources engage with your brand by tracking your
                            website visitors. This tells you whether your social content makes your audience visitors to
                            a site (who you can also re-target later). We have social media sources such as Facebook,
                            Instagram, and Twitter at Syolo Outsourcing.

                        <p class="p1">
                            The traffic on the web is first step, but everyone knows that the magic occurs in those
                            email opts. We are major email vendors and can directly assign the majority of our sales to
                            email. But the attribution problem arises again.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            What if an email subscriber came from society first? Social credit must be granted to us.
                            This is where the source e-mail opt-ins arrive. We know how many email subscribers we get
                            from our social audience using this metric. Ex. 2% of the subscribers of our e-mail
                            transform our flagship service. If we can get 100 social network subscribers a week, this
                            means that we can allocate approximately 2 of those sales to social services.

                        <p class="p1">
                            Now is the time to directly sell social products, so things will be difficult. Since it's
                            still impossible to assign sales to specific contact points with confidence, we'll only get
                            an idea of how many conversions come from society with sales by source.
                        </p>

                            We say "just get an idea," because even though somebody has purchased from social
                            companies—this does not mean social credit. This customer could have found us via social
                            services, revisited our offer and decided to purchase it. Social certainly played a role in
                            this conversion, but our blog posts and our homepage also did. We will provide a social
                            sales loan, but we don't think it was naive.

                        <p class="p1">
                            As Sales by Source cannot give you a true story of why somebody bought it, you want to use
                            Linear and Time Decay attribution’s too. (Sales by Source are far more straight lines than
                            it was).
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            You want both metrics to be clear. While Sales by Source isn't perfect, it's still helpful
                            to find which products to promote in your businesses. Linear and Time Decay will show you
                            how on average your businesses transform.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            Each visit in the Look-back Window gives the same credit for linear attributions. Time Decay
                            offers more credit and less credit for recent visits within a Look-back Window.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            This gives you an insight into where you were before you bought it. We propose that you set
                            these attributions on all your digital, not only social, channels. You can see with these
                            data which of your social channels are most often involved in conversions. You can see that
                            there are no highest conversions to social networks, but they do have the highest Linear and
                            Time Decay. Whilst it says that our social ROI may not look great, our audience really turns
                            into social customers. You want to figure out what the real story is with these
                            measurements. If you compare them to sales by source, you will reduce things behind the
                            scenes and lead to sales.

                        <p class="p1">
                            To date, heavy metrics and Google Analytics were included in all the ways to track your
                            social media ROI. We get it, however. You're only a one-person team sometimes trying to
                            figure out how to get more sales. Other times your team is so busy, you may not be able to
                            set up these attributions right now—but you have to determine your social returns. There are
                            two strategies.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            The first is a special discount for your social audience. You can also give your own
                            discount to your various channels (INSTAGRAM10, TWITTER10, FACEBOOK10, YOU TUBE10). These are
                            each 10% off, but you will see where the customer was from without a steep curve of learning
                            from Google Analytics.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            Your aim is to see how many members of the audience become customers. Identify the rate of
                            your conversion based on your commitment and followers. You know, for example, that your
                            conversion rate is 1 per cent of your followers with 10,000 social followers and you are
                            getting 100 sales. You know your convert ratio is 5 percent your commitment rate, if you
                            generally get 500 likes, comment and save on your post.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            These numbers will help you build a predictable selling system. Predictable sales systems
                            (PSS) take you out of the mentality "I hope I will make cash this year" and "I know how much
                            money I make this year."
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            You can tell how much to expect from your social services before you go to full Google

                            pages for your social networks only. You can make a landing page for your entire social
                            network or create a different page for each social network.

                            we are looking for. Because this page is for your social audience, your conversions may take

                            Let's say you have a social audience of 10,000 people and 1% convert every quarter. Your bid
                            is $500, so every quarter you get $50,000 from social. You cost $100,000 per year to your
                            social team. Now you know that you spend $100,000 on social affairs and earn $100,000 on
                            profit (after subtracting your investment from your yearly profit).

                            Social listening has become so famous because in 2021 and beyond it is an absolute
                            necessity. Marketers have used their social channels for years to survey their audiences and
                            ask them what they want or what products they need. The next level of social listening is
                            this survey.

                            When a brand listens to its audience on social channels, social listening takes place.
                            Hearing your audience means you read comments and search for tagged content to tell you
                            where the feeling of your customers is. Sometimes that feeling has specifically to do with
                            your brand, and sometimes global events are involved.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            Brands can, for example, use social listening to their audience views about their latest
                            campaign or look at what their customers think about their products. Or, brands can use
                            social listening to know what their customers talk about and find a way to get involved.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            The future of marketing is social listening. It was always part of marketing technically.
                            Brands have heard their clients for years by asking for surveys to be completed and feedback
                            to be provided. Marketers access their customers in social media differently. They can fly
                            in the walls of the conversations that their audience, and customers, instead of obtaining
                            their filtered opinions through curated surveys and feedback.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            This gives marketers the opportunity to organize campaigns to address their customers'
                            thoughts and ideas. <br>
                            For example, where a beauty brand realise that its audience always needs a particular
                            shadow colour of the eye – and the brand still doesn't have that colour – social listeners
                            can use to validate the new shadow colour of the eye. When it comes to social listening,
                            this is just the tip of the iceberg.

                        <p class="p1">
                            Brands can notice if their audience talks about a particular library, podcast, episode or
                            television programme and produce content they are aware of.

                            This is, for example, how Lowe has socially used ice in the parking lot to listen to their
                            public complaint. They said to the customer what store they went to to get salt on the car
                            park and avoid further complaints or, worse, accidents. Social listening can most of the
                            time be used to build a better experience. This experience can be either in the first three
                            phases (consciousness, commitment and subscription) of customer value trips before someone
                            becomes a customer or in the fourth phase (conversion).

                            Marketers are able to see a new side of their customer base with social listening—a side
                            that does not emerge in curated surveys and other feedback.
